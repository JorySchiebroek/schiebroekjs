    Context

<p>
    Christmas was closing in, and DisneyXD started a campaign in which they offered a digital advent calendar.
    Children could go to their website and open a box every day to receive a digital treat. This could be a video, a coloring page, or a minigame.
    My assignment was to design one of these minigames.

    Approach
</p>

<p>
    The game was supposed to be reused so I decided to make an arcade game with simple gameplay.
    Thinking back of my own childhood, I quickly had a list of 10 concepts.
    I choose the three that made me most enthousiastic, and presented more visual concepts to the team.

    <span class="mt-2">Final three concepts</span>
</div>

<p>
    We decided to go with number 2, since the interaction was simple enough for small children.
    Furthermore, the amount of variables in it made it easier to find the right difficulty.
    Since the game itself was pretty straight forward, I started designing the UI with themed DisneyXD assets that were available to me.

<div class="has-background-light js-is-rounded my-4 p-4" fxLayout="column" fxLayoutGap="8px" fxLayoutAlign="center center">
    <img class="js-is-rounded-sm" src="../../../assets/disney/flowchart2.jpg">
    <span class="mt-2">Mobile flowchart</span>
</div>

<p>
    First, I created a navigationable prototype so we could test various things not directly related to the game.
    This included e.g. the size of the game field, disabling the music and pausing the game.

    Result
</p>
<p>
    I finished my internship with a working minigame that was launched in the calendar and was played by many children.
    Unfortunately enough, the game is not showable nowadays since that particular Disney platform is not available anymore.
